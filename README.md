# FFMpegAPI
FFMpegAPI is Bukkit plugin providing ffmpegapi for most of audio stream/file to WAVE format AudioInputStream. Also this plugin will add Youtube links and most of audio support for 
[PlasmoVoiceAddon](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plasmovoiceaddon.99253).

### Why this is exists?
This exists for adding support of youtube links and most of audio format. Because library weight too much (~17 MB), and i don`t want to force people download support of youtube links and most of audio formats. Also 
this is "example" for using PlasmoVoiceAddon API.
